# Population Health Management UI Application

This is a simple UI application which will be used to demonstrate the [Population Health Management System Demo](https://github.com/mauriziocarioli/PHM-Processes) 



This application has two UI screens. One provides an administrative view which can be used to demonstrate the login for a Doctor(Peter), Charlie(Insurance Channel Worker) and Robert(Pharmacist).
The screen can be accessed at http://localhost:8037/static/phm_management.html

The `Logged in User` lets us switch between the 3 different users. For example, when choosing the Doctor's perspective, you will see the screen as below.
